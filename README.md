# retimer
When I cook and particularly when I cook vegetables, I need a regular reminder to check
on the food. Enter the retimer.

The retimer is (or will be) a cooking timer that re-triggers every x minutes to go and
check on the food cooking.

## PyBadge
retimer is currently developed for the Adafruit PyBadge, in CircuitPython 5.3.0.
